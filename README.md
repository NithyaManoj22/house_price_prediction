House pricing is one of the most spoken of topic ever since time immemorial.Houses are priced differently in different places depending on a wide range of parameters.Our problem involves prediction of house prices based on a set of parameters obtained from the dataset.
For our train data,all the above parameters are given as input.For our test data,all the parameters besides price shall be given as input ,letting the algorithm predict the price.

We have done this in three steps
1. Visualising the data and observe which parameters affect price to a larger extent.
2. Feed the test and train data to the system.
3. Predict price using ML techniques. In this case we have used linear regression.
